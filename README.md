# Odin Foundations - Recipe Project
 - The main webpage can be found in the index.html, where I have the title for the project, with an ordered list of my favourite 4 recipes
 - Each list tag will link to a page with the recipes I've used, some from online, and others from our cookbook at home.
 - Each Recipe page has an image of the product I've made, with a description, and a link to the original website I got the recipe from (if relevant).
 - Obviously, there are ingredients and directions too.
